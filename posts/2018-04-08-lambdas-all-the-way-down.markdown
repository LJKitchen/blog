title: It's lambdas all the way down! [DRAFT]

<em>Work in progress.  Not ready for publication.</em>

When you're first introduced to functional programming, the
distinction's often made between &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;
functions, which operate on data, and so-called
&ldquo;higher-order&rdquo; functions, which operate on other
functions.  But this distinction, while perhaps useful as a
conceptual path, is in a way bogus.  From a deep theoretical
point of view, there is no distinction &mdash; <em>all</em>
functions are &ldquo;higher order&rdquo;.
